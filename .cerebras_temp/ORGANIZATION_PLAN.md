# 📋 Branch Organization Plan

## Current Situation (cerebras-test branch)

You have **uncommitted changes** on the `cerebras-test` branch from our work session:

### Modified Files (documentation updates):
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Added multi-agent layer
- `PRD.md` - Added v0.5 features  
- `UX.md` - Added enhanced state

### New Files Created:
**Core Implementation:**
- `langgraph_agent.py` - Your enhanced multi-agent system
- `requirements-langgraph.txt` - Dependencies

**Cerebras Example:**
- `cerebras_example.py` - Direct Cerebras implementation for testing

**Documentation:**
- `VISION_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Complete vision with diagrams
- `QUICK_START.md` - Demo preparation guide
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - What was added
- `CEREBRAS_COMPARISON.md` - Testing guide

**Utilities:**
- `test_setup.py` - Setup verification script
- `.env` - Environment variables (already exists)

---

## 🎯 Recommended Organization Strategy

### Option 1: Keep Everything on cerebras-test (Recommended)
**Purpose:** This branch becomes your "multi-agent enhancement" branch

```bash
# Commit everything here
git add .
git commit -m "Add multi-agent system with LangGraph (Cerebras-inspired)

- Implemented 7 specialized agents for UX research
- Added LangGraph state machine orchestration  
- Created Cerebras example for comparison
- Updated documentation with vision and architecture
- Added setup scripts and quick start guide"

# Then you can merge to master when ready
```

**Pros:**
- Everything is together and testable
- Easy to demo from this branch
- Can merge to master after demo validation

---

### Option 2: Split Into Separate Commits
**Purpose:** Keep documentation separate from code

```bash
# Commit 1: Documentation updates
git add ARCHITECTURE.md PRD.md UX.md
git add VISION_ARCHITECTURE.md IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md QUICK_START.md
git commit -m "docs: Update architecture and add multi-agent vision"

# Commit 2: Core implementation
git add langgraph_agent.py requirements-langgraph.txt test_setup.py
git commit -m "feat: Add LangGraph multi-agent research system"

# Commit 3: Cerebras example
git add cerebras_example.py CEREBRAS_COMPARISON.md
git commit -m "test: Add Cerebras example for comparison"
```

**Pros:**
- Clean commit history
- Easy to review changes
- Can cherry-pick specific commits if needed

---

### Option 3: Move Some Back to Master
**Purpose:** Keep documentation on master, experiments on branch

```bash
# Switch to master
git checkout master

# Bring over just documentation
git checkout cerebras-test -- VISION_ARCHITECTURE.md QUICK_START.md IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
git add VISION_ARCHITECTURE.md QUICK_START.md IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
git commit -m "docs: Add multi-agent vision and setup guides"

# Switch back to cerebras-test for code
git checkout cerebras-test
git add langgraph_agent.py cerebras_example.py requirements-langgraph.txt
git commit -m "feat: Multi-agent implementation and Cerebras example"
```

**Pros:**
- Documentation visible on master
- Experimental code isolated
- Can iterate on cerebras-test

---

## 💡 My Recommendation: Option 1

**Why?**
1. You want to demo tomorrow - keep everything together
2. This branch is specifically for testing the Cerebras approach
3. After successful demo, merge to master
4. Clean and simple

**Steps:**
```bash
# 1. Commit everything on cerebras-test
git add .
git commit -m "Add multi-agent system (Cerebras-inspired) for demo"

# 2. Test it
python test_setup.py
python cerebras_example.py

# 3. After successful demo tomorrow
git checkout master
git merge cerebras-test
git push origin master
```

## 📁 File Purpose Guide

### For Your Demo Tomorrow:

**Use These:**
- `langgraph_agent.py` - Your enhanced system (show this!)
- `cerebras_example.py` - Comparison (optional)
- `VISION_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Show the vision diagram
- `QUICK_START.md` - Your setup guide

**Present These:**
- Updated `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Show multi-agent layer
- Updated `PRD.md` - Show roadmap
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - What you built

**Run This:**
- `test_setup.py` - Verify everything works
- `web_app.py` - Your main demo

---

## ✅ Quick Action Plan (Right Now)

### Step 1: Commit on cerebras-test
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add multi-agent system with LangGraph (Cerebras-inspired)

- Multi-agent implementation with 7 specialized agents
- Cerebras example for comparison
- Complete documentation and vision
- Demo preparation materials"
```

### Step 2: Verify Everything Works
```bash
# Test setup
python test_setup.py

# Add your API keys to .env
code .env  # or nano .env

# Test the system
python langgraph_agent.py
```

### Step 3: Prepare for Demo
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements-langgraph.txt

# Test with sample audio
python web_app.py
```

### Step 4: After Demo Success
```bash
git checkout master
git merge cerebras-test
git push origin master
```

## 🚫 What NOT to Do

- ❌ Don't commit to master yet - test on this branch first
- ❌ Don't split files across branches randomly
- ❌ Don't commit `.env` file (it's in .gitignore)
- ❌ Don't commit `__pycache__` or `.specstory` folders
