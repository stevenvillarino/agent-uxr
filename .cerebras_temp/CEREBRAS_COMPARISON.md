# 🧪 Cerebras Example Branch - Testing the Approach

This branch contains a direct implementation of the Cerebras User Research Automation approach so you can test it and compare with your enhanced system.

## 📁 What's in This Branch

### New Files:
- **`cerebras_example.py`** - Direct implementation of Cerebras approach
- **`CEREBRAS_COMPARISON.md`** - This file

### Your Original Files:
- **`langgraph_agent.py`** - Your enhanced multi-agent system
- **`web_app.py`** - Your web interface with audio support
- All your existing documentation

---

## 🎯 Purpose

Test the Cerebras approach side-by-side with your system to:
1. Understand their methodology
2. Compare results quality
3. Identify what to adopt vs what you've improved
4. Validate your enhancements

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies (if not already done)
```bash
pip install -r requirements-langgraph.txt
```

### 2. Configure API Keys in `.env`
```bash
# You need at least one of these:
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here  # Recommended
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here     # Fallback
```

### 3. Run the Cerebras Example
```bash
python cerebras_example.py
```

This will:
- Ask for a research question
- Generate synthetic personas
- Conduct automated interviews
- Synthesize insights

## 🧪 Testing Workflow

### Test 1: Cerebras Baseline
```bash
python cerebras_example.py
```
- Research question: "developer experience with AI tools"
- Demographic: "software engineers"
- Note the insights generated
- Time: ~1-2 minutes

### Test 2: Your Enhanced System
```bash
python langgraph_agent.py
```
- Same research question
- Compare depth of insights
- Notice additional features
- Time: ~2-3 minutes

### Test 3: With Real Audio
```bash
python web_app.py
# Upload actual interview audio
```
- Real transcription with speakers
- Richer context for analysis
- Professional presentation output

## 🔄 Example Comparison

### Same Input: Developer Interview

**Cerebras Approach:**
```
Input: Text research question
→ Generate 5 synthetic developers
→ Interview each with 5 questions
→ Synthesize insights
Output: Text analysis
```

**Your Approach:**
```
Input: Real audio interview (MP3/WAV)
→ Transcribe with speaker labels (ElevenLabs)
→ Extract themes from real conversation
→ Generate personas based on actual data
→ Conduct synthetic interviews for depth
→ Cross-analyze real + synthetic
→ Create professional presentation
Output: Slides + charts + reports
```
