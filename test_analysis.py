User: I'm really frustrated with the loading times on the new dashboard. It takes forever to load.

Interviewer: Can you tell me more about what you're experiencing?

User: Well, when I first open the dashboard, I have to wait at least 30 seconds before I can see any data. And when I try to filter the results, it freezes for a few seconds.

Interviewer: That sounds frustrating. Are there any aspects of the dashboard that you do like?

User: Actually, yes. Once it loads, the layout is much cleaner than before. The navigation is more intuitive, and I love the new search functionality. The filters work really well once they load.

Interviewer: What about the data visualization?

User: The charts and graphs are excellent. Much easier to understand than the previous version. I just wish the performance was better.
