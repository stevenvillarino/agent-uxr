Good morning, thank you for joining us today for this user interview about our dashboard interface. I'm Sarah, your moderator. Could you please introduce yourself and tell us a bit about your role?
Hi Sarah, I'm Alex. I'm a product manager at a mid-size tech company, and I use analytics dashboards daily to track our product metrics and make data-driven decisions.
Perfect. Let's start by having you take a look at this dashboard interface. What are your first impressions?
Well, the first thing I notice is that it's quite clean and modern looking. I like the color scheme. However, I'm immediately overwhelmed by the number of widgets on the screen. There's a lot of information competing for my attention.
That's really helpful feedback. Can you walk me through how you would typically approach using a dashboard like this?
Sure. Usually when I open a dashboard, I'm looking for one specific piece of information or I want to get a quick overview of how things are performing. The problem I see here is that I can't immediately tell what the most important metrics are. Everything seems to have equal visual weight.
Interesting. If you had to prioritize the information you see here, what would be most important to you?
For my role, I'd want to see the key performance indicators first - things like user growth, revenue metrics, conversion rates. Then maybe some trend information showing if we're moving in the right direction. The detailed breakdowns could be secondary.
What about the navigation? How intuitive does it feel to you?
The navigation is a bit confusing to be honest. I see these tabs at the top, but I'm not sure what the difference is between "Analytics" and "Insights" - those feel like they could be the same thing. And this sidebar menu has so many options that I don't know where to start.
That's valuable feedback. Let's talk about customization. How important is it for you to be able to customize your dashboard view?
Oh, that's huge for me. Every product manager looks at different metrics depending on their focus area. I'd love to be able to hide widgets I don't need and maybe resize the ones that are most important to me. Even better would be if the dashboard could learn what I look at most and prioritize those.
Great point about learning and prioritization. What about the data refresh rate? I notice there's a timestamp in the corner showing when data was last updated.
That's actually really important. Nothing worse than making decisions on stale data. But I'd prefer if it was more prominent - maybe a color indicator or something that shows if the data is fresh or if there might be delays.
How do you feel about the mobile experience? Would you use this dashboard on your phone?
I do check dashboards on mobile pretty frequently, especially when I'm traveling or in meetings. But looking at this, I think it would be really cramped on a phone screen. All these widgets would be tiny. Maybe there could be a mobile-optimized view that shows just the most critical metrics in a simplified format.
Last question - if you could change one thing about this dashboard to make it more useful for your day-to-day work, what would it be?
I think the biggest improvement would be better information hierarchy. Show me the most important stuff prominently, and then let me drill down into details when I need them. Maybe use progressive disclosure - start with the big picture and let me click to get more granular data.
Excellent feedback, Alex. This has been really insightful. Thank you for taking the time to share your perspective with us today.
Happy to help! I'm excited to see how the dashboard evolves. It has good bones, just needs some user-focused refinements.
