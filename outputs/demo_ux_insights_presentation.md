# User Interview Dashboard
## UX Research Insights

*Generated by Agent-UXR*
*Analysis Date: October 07, 2025*

---

## Executive Summary

Dashboard usability testing revealed critical information hierarchy issues causing cognitive overload, unclear navigation taxonomy creating user confusion, and overwhelming choice architecture. Users appreciate visual design but struggle with functional organization.

---

## Key UX Themes

### 1. Information hierarchy failure
 Multiple widgets compete for attention without clear priority signaling, causing immediate cognitive overload - participant said 'I'm immediately overwhelmed by the number of widgets on the screen'

### 2. Navigation taxonomy confusion  
 'Analytics' vs 'Insights' labels create mental model mismatch - user stated 'I'm not sure what the difference is between Analytics and Insights - those feel like they could be the same thing'

---

## ðŸš¨ Critical Pain Points

**1.** Cognitive overload from widget density: 'I'm immediately overwhelmed by the number of widgets on the screen' - too many competing visual elements

**2.** Mental model mismatch in navigation: 'I'm not sure what the difference is between Analytics and Insights - those feel like they could be the same thing'

**3.** Decision paralysis from equal visual weight: 'I can't immediately tell what the most important metrics are. Everything seems to have equal visual weight'

## ðŸ’¡ Prioritized Recommendations

### 1. CRITICAL
 Implement visual hierarchy with primary/secondary widget styling to immediately address cognitive overload and enable quick metric identification

### 2. HIGH
 Consolidate 'Analytics' and 'Insights' navigation into unified 'Data' section with task-based sub-navigation rather than technical categories

## Next Steps

1. **Prioritize** critical pain points for immediate fixes
2. **Prototype** visual hierarchy solutions  
3. **Validate** changes with follow-up user testing
4. **Measure** impact with analytics and user feedback
