  "summary": "Dashboard usability testing revealed critical information hierarchy issues causing cognitive overload, unclear navigation taxonomy creating user confusion, and overwhelming choice architecture. Users appreciate visual design but struggle with functional organization.",
  "themes": [
    "Information hierarchy failure: Multiple widgets compete for attention without clear priority signaling, causing immediate cognitive overload - participant said 'I'm immediately overwhelmed by the number of widgets on the screen'",
    "Navigation taxonomy confusion: 'Analytics' vs 'Insights' labels create mental model mismatch - user stated 'I'm not sure what the difference is between Analytics and Insights - those feel like they could be the same thing'",
    "Priority uncertainty blocking task completion: Visual weight equality prevents efficient navigation - 'I can't immediately tell what the most important metrics are. Everything seems to have equal visual weight'",
    "Role-based customization demand: Product managers need metric prioritization - 'I'd want to see the key performance indicators first - things like user growth, revenue metrics, conversion rates'"
  ],
  "pain_points": [
    "Cognitive overload from widget density: 'I'm immediately overwhelmed by the number of widgets on the screen' - too many competing visual elements",
    "Mental model mismatch in navigation: 'I'm not sure what the difference is between Analytics and Insights - those feel like they could be the same thing'",
    "Decision paralysis from equal visual weight: 'I can't immediately tell what the most important metrics are. Everything seems to have equal visual weight'",
    "Workflow interruption requiring prioritization: 'There's a lot of information competing for my attention' prevents efficient task completion"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "CRITICAL: Implement visual hierarchy with primary/secondary widget styling to immediately address cognitive overload and enable quick metric identification",
    "HIGH: Consolidate 'Analytics' and 'Insights' navigation into unified 'Data' section with task-based sub-navigation rather than technical categories",
    "MEDIUM: Add role-based dashboard customization (PM, Marketing, Sales) with relevant KPI defaults to reduce information density",
    "LONG-TERM: Conduct card sorting study to redesign information architecture based on user mental models and task flows"

  "user_quotes": [
    "I'm immediately overwhelmed by the number of widgets on the screen",
    "I can't immediately tell what the most important metrics are. Everything seems to have equal visual weight",
    "I'm not sure what the difference is between Analytics and Insights - those feel like they could be the same thing",
    "There's a lot of information competing for my attention",
    "It's quite clean and modern looking. I like the color scheme",
    "I'd want to see the key performance indicators first - things like user growth, revenue metrics, conversion rates"
